# rotational-motion-visualizer
- This is a short python pygame project. It helps in visualizing the rotating motion of a wheel.  
- I have used pure physics equations in making of this. 
- It is assumed that the recoil force is acting at tangential direction. 
- It also tells the instaneous quantities of the rigid body such as angular momentum and angular velocity
